Files and Locations

.. _extension-files:

Files
=====

An extension consists of:

1. A directory named by the *extension key* (which is a worldwide unique
   identification string for the extension), usually located in :file:`typo3conf/ext`
   for local extensions, or :file:`typo3/sysext` for system extensions.

2. Standard files with reserved names for configuration related to TYPO3
   (of which most are optional, see list below)

3. Any number of additional files for the extension functionality itself.


.. _extension-reserved-filenames:

Reserved File Names
===================

This lists special files within an extension that have a special meaning
by convention. If put at the according places, TYPO3 will find them and
use for specific functionality. For example, if a svg logo of your extension
is placed at :file:`Resources/Public/Icons/Extension.svg`, the Extension Manager
will show that image.

Nearly none of these are required, but for example you can not have a TYPO3
extension recognized by TYPO3 without the :file:`ext_emconf.php` file, etc. You
can read more details like that in the table below.

In general, do not introduce your own files in the root directory of
extensions with the name prefix :file:`ext_`.

 - :Filename,20: Filename
   :Description,80: Description


 - :Filename: :file:`ext_emconf.php`
   :Description:
         Definition of extension properties. This is the only mandatory file in the extension.
         It describes the extension for the rest of TYPO3.

         Name, category, status etc. used by the Extension Manager. The content of this file
         is described in more details :ref:`below <extension-declaration>`. Note
         that it is auto-written by Extension Manager when extensions are imported from the repository.

         .. note::

            If this file is *not* present, the Extension Manager will *not* find the
            extension.


 - :Filename: :file:`ext_localconf.php`
   :Description:
         Addition to :file:`LocalConfiguration.php` which is included if found.
         Should contain additional configuration of :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']`.

         This file contains hook definitions and plugin configuration. It must
         not contain a PHP encoding declaration.

         All :file:`ext_localconf.php` files of loaded extensions are
         included right  *after* the files :file:`typo3conf/LocalConfiguration.php`
         and :file:`typo3conf/AdditionalConfiguration.php` during TYPO3
         :ref:`bootstrap <bootstrapping>`.

         Pay attention to the rules for the contents of these files.
         For more details, see the :ref:`section below <extension-configuration-files>`.


 - :Filename: :file:`ext_tables.php`
   :Description:
         Included if found. Contains extensions of existing tables,
         declaration of backend modules, etc. All code in such files
         is included after all the default definitions provided by the Core and
         loaded after :file:`ext_localconf.php` files during TYPO3
         :ref:`bootstrap <bootstrapping>`.

         Pay attention to the rules for the contents of these files.
         For more details, see the :ref:`section below <extension-configuration-files>`.

         .. note::
            In old TYPO3 core versions, this file contained additions to the
            global :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA']` array. This changed since core version 6.2
            to allow effective caching:

            TCA definition of new database tables must be done entirely
            in :file:`Configuration/TCA/<table name>.php`.
            These files are expected to contain the full TCA of the given table
            (as an array) and simply return it (with a :php:`return` statement).

            Customizations of existing tables must be done entirely
            in :file:`Configuration/TCA/Overrides/<table name>.php`.


 - :Filename: :file:`ext_tables.sql`
   :Description:
         SQL definition of database tables.

         This file should contain a table-structure dump of the tables used by
         the extension. It is used for evaluation of the database structure and
         is therefore important to check and update the database when an
         extension is enabled.

         If you add additional fields (or depend on certain fields) to existing tables
         you can also put them here. In that case insert a :code:`CREATE TABLE` structure
         for that table, but remove all lines except the ones defining the fields you need,
         here is an example adding a column to the pages table:

         .. code-block:: sql

            CREATE TABLE pages (
                tx_myext_field int(11) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL,
            );

         TYPO3 will merge this table definition to the existing table definition when
         comparing expected and actual table definitions. Partial definitions
         can also contain indexes and other directives. They can also change
         existing table fields though that is not recommended, because it may
         create problems with the TYPO3 core and/or other extensions.

         The :file:`ext_tables.sql` file may not necessarily be "dumpable"
         directly to MySQL (because of the semi-complete table definitions allowed
         defining only required fields). But the Extension Manager or Install Tool can handle this.
         The only very important thing is that the syntax of the content is exactly
         like MySQL made it so that the parsing and analysis of the file is
         done correctly by the Extension Manager.

         TYPO3 parses :code:`ext_tables.sql` files. TYPO3 expects that all
         table definitions in this file look like the ones produced by the
         :code:`mysqldump` utility. Incorrect definitions may not be recognized
         by the TYPO3 SQL parser or may lead to MySQL errors, when TYPO3 tries
         to apply them. If TYPO3 is not running on MySQL or directly compatible
         other DBMS like MariaDB, the system will parse the file towards the
         target DBMS like PostgreSQL.


 - :Filename: :file:`ext_tables_static+adt.sql`
   :Description:
         Static SQL tables and their data.

         If the extension requires static data you can dump it into a sql-file
         by this name. Example for dumping mysql data from bash (being in the
         extension directory):

         .. code-block:: shell

            mysqldump --add-drop-table \
                      --password=[password] [database name] \
                      [tablename]  > ./ext_tables_static.sql

         :code:`--add-drop-table` will make sure to include a DROP TABLE
         statement so any data is inserted in a fresh table.

         You can also drop the table content using the Extension Manager in the backend.

         .. note::

            The table structure of static tables needs to be in the
            :file:`ext_tables.sql` file as well - otherwise an installed static
            table will be reported as being in excess in the Install Tool.

         .. warning::

            Static data is not meant to be extended by other extensions. On
            re-import all extended fields and data is lost due to `DROP TABLE`
            statements.


 - :Filename: :file:`ext_typoscript_constants.typoscript`
   :Description:
         Preset TypoScript constants. Will be included in the constants section
         of all TypoScript templates.

         .. warning::

            Use such a file if you absolutely need to load some TS (because you
            would get serious errors without it). Otherwise static templates or
            usage of the *Extension Management API* of class
            :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility` are preferred.


 - :Filename: :file:`ext_typoscript_setup.typoscript`
   :Description:
         Preset TypoScript setup. Will be included in the setup section of all
         TypoScript templates.

         .. warning::

            Use such a file if you absolutely need to load some TS (because you
            would get serious errors without it). Otherwise static templates or
            usage of the *Extension Management API* of class
            :php:`TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility` are preferred.


 - :Filename: :file:`ext_conf_template.txt`
   :Description:
         Extension Configuration template.

         Configuration code in TypoScript syntax setting up a series of values
         which can be configured for the extension in the Install Tool.
         :ref:`Read more about the file format here <extension-options>`.

         If this file is present 'Settings' of the Install Tool provides you with an
         interface for editing the configuration values defined in the file. The result is
         written as an array to :file:`LocalConfiguration.php`
         in the variable :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTENSIONS'][`:code:`*extension_key*` :php:`]`


 - :Filename: :file:`Configuration/Backend/Routes.php` and :file:`Configuration/Backend/AjaxRoutes.php`
   :Description:
         Registry of backend routes. Extensions that add backend modules must
         register their routes here to be correctly linkable in the backend.
         The file must return an array with routing details. See core extensions
         like :php:`backend` for examples.


 - :Filename: :file:`Resources/Public/Icons/Extension.svg`
   :Description:
         Extension icon. If exists, this icon is displayed in the Extension Manager.
         Preferred is using an SVG file, Extension icon will look nicer when provided
         as vector graphics (SVG) rather than bitmaps (GIF or PNG).

         18x16 GIF, PNG or SVG icon for the extension.


 - :Filename: :file:`class.ext_update.php`
   :Description:
         See section :ref:`update-wizards-extupdatefile` in chapter
         :ref:`update-wizards`.

.. _extension-reserved-folders:

Reserved Folders
================

In the early days, every extension baked it own bread when it came to
file locations of PHP classes, public web resources and templates.

With the rise of Extbase, a generally accepted structure for file
locations inside extensions has been established. If extension authors
stick to this, the system helps in various ways. For instance, if putting
PHP classes into the :file:`Classes/` folder and naming classes accordingly,
the system will be able to autoload these without further action from the
developer.

Extension kickstarters like the `Extension Builder extension
<https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/extension_builder>`_ will create
the correct structure for you.

It is described below:

Classes
  Contains all PHP classes. One class per file. Should have sub folders like
  :code:`Controller/`, :code:`Domain/`, :code:`Service/` or :code:`View/`.
  For more details on class file namings an PHP namespaces, see chapter
  :ref:`namespaces <namespaces>`.

Classes/Controller
  Contains MVC Controller classes.

Classes/Domain/Model
  Contains MVC Domain model classes.

Classes/Domain/Repository
  Contains data repository classes.

Classes/ViewHelpers
  Helper classes used in (Fluid) views.

Configuration
  General configuration folder. Some of the sub directories in here like :file:`TCA`
  and :file:`Backend` have special meaning and files in there are automatically
  included during TYPO3 bootstrap.

Configuration/Backend/
  Contains backend routing configurations. See files description of :php:`Routes.php`
  and :php:`AjaxRoutes.php` :ref:`above <extension-reserved-filenames>`.

Configuration/TCA
  One file per database table, using the name of the table for the file, plus
  ".php". Only for new tables.

Configuration/TCA/Overrides
  For extending existing tables, one file per database table, using the name of
  the table for the file, plus ".php".

Configuration/TsConfig/Page
  Page TSconfig, see chapter :ref:`'Page TSconfig' in the TSconfig Reference
  <t3tsconfig:PageTSconfig>`. Files should have the file extension
  :file:`.tsconfig`.

Configuration/TsConfig/User
  User TSconfig, see chapter :ref:`'User TSconfig' in the TSconfig Reference
  <t3tsconfig:UserTSconfig>`. Files should have the file extension
  :file:`.tsconfig`.

Configuration/TypoScript
  TypoScript static setup (:file:`setup.typoscript`) and constants
  (:file:`constants.typoscript`). Use subfolders if you have several static
  templates.

Documentation
  Contains the extension documentation in ReStructuredText (ReST, .rst) format.
  Read more on the topic in chapter :ref:`extension documentation <extension-documentation>`.
  :file:`Documentation/` and its subfolders may contain several ReST files, images and other resources.

Documentation/Index.rst
  This file contains the cover page of the extension manual in ReST
  format. The name or format of the file may not be changed. You may
  include other ReST files as you like. See the `"Extension Template" on docs.typo3.org`_
  for more information about structure and syntax of extension manuals.

  .. _"Extension Template" on docs.typo3.org: https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/ExtensionManualExample/

Resources
  Contains the subfolders :code:`Public/` and :code:`Private/`, which
  contain resources, possibly in further subfolders, e.g.
  :code:`Templates/`, :code:`Css/`, :code:`Language/`, :code:`Images/`
  or :code:`JavaScript/`. This is also the directory for non–TYPO3 files supplied with the
  extension. TYPO3 is licensed under GPL version 2 or any later version.
  Any non–TYPO3 code must be compatible with GPL version 2 or any later
  version.

Resources/Private/Language
  XLIFF files for localized labels.

Resources/Private/Layouts
  Main layouts for (Fluid) views.

Resources/Private/Partials
  Partial templates for repetitive use.

Resources/Private/Templates
  One template per action, stored in a folder named after each Controller.

Resources/Public/Css
  Any CSS file used by the extension.

Resources/Public/Images
  Any images used by the extension.

Resources/Public/JavaScript
  Any JS file used by the extension.

Tests/Unit
  Contains unit tests and fixtures.

Tests/Functional
  Contains functional tests and fixtures.
