===========================
Extending the User Settings
===========================

Adding fields to the User Settings is done in two steps.
First of all, the new fields are added directly to the
:php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_USER_SETTINGS']` array. Then the
field is made visible by calling
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addFieldsToUserSettings()`.

The configuration needs to be put into :file:`ext_tables.php`.

Here is an example, taken from the "examples" extension::

   $GLOBALS['TYPO3_USER_SETTINGS']['columns']['tx_examples_mobile'] = array(
      'label' => 'LLL:EXT:examples/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_db.xlf:be_users.tx_examples_mobile',
      'type' => 'text',
      'table' => 'be_users',
   );
   \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Utility\ExtensionManagementUtility::addFieldsToUserSettings(
      'LLL:EXT:examples/Resources/Private/Language/locallang_db.xlf:be_users.tx_examples_mobile,tx_examples_mobile',
      'after:email'
   );

The second parameter in the call to :php:`addFieldsToUserSettings()`
is used to position the new field. In this example, we decide to add it
after the existing "email" field.

In this example the field is also added to the "be_users" table. This is
not described here as it belongs to 'extending the $TCA array'.
See label 'extending' in older versions of the TCA-Reference.

And here is the new field in the User Tools > User Settings module:
